			Hello! My name is Jonathan, but you already knew that. I'm a 2nd year Computer Science major at UCLA. 
			<br><br>
			In my time at UCLA, I've had the opportunity to explore the great realm of computers, code, and engineering through the wonderful coursework provided by the CS department in addition to technical experience I've gained outside of class through various projects and organizations. I currently work for UCLA Library as a developer on the BuildUCLA team. We're working on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/UCLALibrary/CC-ing">Community Cataloging</a>, a project whose goal is to streamline the process of cataloging books written in foreign languages that have been for too long off the library shelves.
			<br><br>
			I also had the opportunity to build, from the ground up, the <a target="_blank" href="https://ftc.cnhcirclek.org">website</a> for Fall Training Conference 2017, an event hosted by the <a target="_blank" href="https://cnhcirclek.org">California-Nevada-Hawaii District</a> of Circle K International. The event brings in 600+ attendees annually for a weekend of education, networking, and fun at a mountain campsite in Sonora, CA.
			<br><br>
			At LA Hacks 2017, my project was aimed towards replacing paper programs/pamphlets handed out to attendees at large-scale events, like the conventions and conferences that many organizations hold. It didn't come to full fruition because my partner and I were but beginners in the land of hacking, but you can check out the site <a target="_blank" href="https://jonathanchu78.github.io/Mesh/">here</a>.
			<br><hr>
			When I'm not working on projects, you can often find me designing graphics or volunteering with <a target="_blank" href="http:uclacki.org"> UCLA Circle K</a>. You can check out some of the graphics I've worked on under the <a target="_blank" href="portfolio.html">Graphics</a> tab. I appreciate a good aesthetic in just about anything: graphics, websites, companies, even architecture, and I'm always observing the world around me, looking for cool designs and branding that I can learn from.
			<br><br>
			Although the primary reason for attending a 4-year university is to earn a good education/degree for a future job and income, I strongly believe that not every moment of any person's life should be dedicated to studying or working. It is in moments of pleasure, friendship, and helping others that we gain a sense of who we are and why we're here. As such, I constantly look for opportunities to better myself in ways both within and beyond Computer Science and have done so with organizations like Circle K, the <a target="_blank" href="http://dailybruin.com/">Daily Bruin</a> as part of the graphics team, and <a target="_blank" href="http://msoatucla.weebly.com/">Morning Sign Out</a> as an editor.
			<br><br>
			I also find opportunities during what free time I do have to develop my skill as a musician and hope to continue improving <a target="_blank" href="recordings.html">as a pianist</a> for the rest of my life.
