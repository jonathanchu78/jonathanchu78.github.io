			<h1 class="overlay">Winter Leadership Retreat Overlay</h1>
			<p class="overlay">
				UCLA Circle K planned a large-scale leadership conference called Winter Leadership Camp. Another member created the primary event banner used to advertise it. Using similar elements and fonts from that original banner, I created this profile picture overlay that would be placed on top of members' Facebook profile pictures to further advertise the event.

			<h1 class="dailybruin">Daily Bruin Graphics Mockup</h1>
			<p class="dailybruin">
				This is the mockup graphic I made and submitted with my Daily Bruin Graphics application. Admittedly, it is likely below Daily Bruin quality standards, but I will certainly pick up better infographic design skills as I begin to work on official graphics for Daily Bruin.

				<h1 class="familytakeover">Week 7 GM Banner</h1>
				<p class="familytakeover">
					The latest general meeting event banner I've worked on for UCLA Circle K. It is a lot to look at, but I chose to sacrifice simplicity/minimalism in this case in order to represent each family, of which there are 8, in some unique way, thus the many seemingly random objects around the graphic. I created each symbol individually using Photoshop and Illustrator and put everything together in Illustrator, all in all resulting in a relatable graphic for all club members to enjoy.

			<h1 class="assassins">Assassins Graphic</h1>
			<p class="assassins">
				My latest work as part of the graphics committee at Circle K - the banner for assassins, a multi-week game that ~150 members play until only one is left alive. This was definitely the most fun I've had making a graphic. It was created from scratch with vector elements by tracing over a picture of Turkey (turtle + monkey), our club mascot, in Adobe Illustrator.
