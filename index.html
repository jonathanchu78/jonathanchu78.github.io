					<h1 class="overlay">Winter Leadership Retreat Overlay</h1>
					<p class="overlay">
						Using elements and fonts from Mike's original WLC banner, I created this (underused) overlay that unfortunately could not be utilized to its fullest, but it was still a good opportunity for me to learn some overlay fundamentals. Also it turned out rather well.

					<h1 class="dailybruin">Daily Bruin Graphics Mockup</h1>
					<p class="dailybruin">
						This is the mockup graphic I made and submitted with my Daily Bruin Graphics application. Admittedly, it is likely below Daily Bruin quality standards, but I will certainly pick up better infographic design skills as I begin to work on official graphics for Daily Bruin.

				<h1 class="familytakeover">Week 7 GM Banner</h1>
				<p class="familytakeover">
					The latest GM banner I've worked on. It is a lot to look at, but I chose to sacrifice simplicity/minimalism in this case in order to represent each family in some unique way. Each of the family symbols was recycled from the last family themed GM last quarter for which I made the symbols individually.

				<h1 class="assassins">Assassins Graphic</h1>
					<p class="assassins">
						My latest work as part of graphics committee - the banner for assassins. Definitely the most fun I've had making a graphic. It was done by tracing over a picture of Turkey by Molyka Seang Photography in Adobe Illustrator. Now the Turkey vector graphic is available for future use and modification.
